# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project will create an e-commerce site for a small business of limited inventory. It will allow for searching for products
adding items to shopping carts, browsing images and menu selections. Limiting the number of items available for selection will
keep a tighter overall feel.

This project was inspired by a friend of mine that needed an e-commerce solution for his home-based business. It will be
useful to anyone needing a professional website solution for companies with smaller teams and limited resources.

### Features
User Login: Users will be able to login after creating a profile.
Search Button: Users will be able to type a search query and receive all available matches.
Shopping Cart: Users will be able to add individual items to a shopping cart which hold their data.
Mouse-over Image Reaction: Users will be able to get a bounce motion when they move their mouse over an inventory image.

### Technologies
API
HTML 5
CSS
JavaScript
Node.js
Java
MongoDB

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn Node to an extent. MongoDB will hold the inventory database for the associated API.
The API will likely be the biggest challenge, as I have no experience with them to date. The HTML and CSS
should be more familiar at this stage.
